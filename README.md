# Snackies Landing Page

## Description
I created Snackies, a landing page dedicated to showcasing a service that delivers the world's best snacks right to your doorstep. Built using React, this project emphasizes an engaging and visually appealing interface, designed to attract and inform potential customers about the service. The page highlights my focus on clean design, user-friendly navigation, and React development.
